## Utilities to Convert Models to Tensorflow2
You can find some utilities to convert Torch models to Tensorflow with an experimental Tacotron2 implemenation in Tensorflow2 (>=2.2). However, our released Torch models may not work with this module due to additional changes layer naming convention. Therefore, you need to train new models to be converted to TF.

This is an experimental release. If you encounter an error, please put an issue or in the best send a PR but you are mostly on your own.
