1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,751
Leslie stretched her arms out with a yawn as she woke up to

2
0:0:2,751 --> 0:0:5,503
the sound of birds chirping outside.

3
0:0:5,956 --> 0:0:8,23
Her hair was in a bed state, completely

4
0:0:8,23 --> 0:0:10,89
messy, her half asleep eyes falling to

5
0:0:10,89 --> 0:0:12,156
her alarm clock.

6
0:0:12,609 --> 0:0:16,495


7
0:0:16,495 --> 0:0:20,380
"9:25

8
0:0:20,380 --> 0:0:24,266
am..."

9
0:0:24,719 --> 0:0:26,205
She read out quietly.

10
0:0:26,659 --> 0:0:28,331
She looked around her room, looking

11
0:0:28,331 --> 0:0:30,3
at the writings on it.

12
0:0:30,456 --> 0:0:36,284
Oh

13
0:0:36,284 --> 0:0:42,113
yeah...

14
0:0:42,566 --> 0:0:43,495
That's right.

15
0:0:43,948 --> 0:0:44,970
I'm back.

16
0:0:45,424 --> 0:0:48,349
A small and faint smile appeared on her lips.

17
0:0:48,803 --> 0:0:50,684
She got out of bed and went over to the

18
0:0:50,684 --> 0:0:52,564
window to look outside.

19
0:0:53,18 --> 0:0:55,386
She pulled it up to open it, sticking her head out

20
0:0:55,386 --> 0:0:57,755
to feel the cool fresh air.

21
0:0:58,208 --> 0:1:0,824
Once the cold wind hit her skin, a very satisfied

22
0:1:0,824 --> 0:1:3,441
smile grew on her lips as she closed her eyes to feel

23
0:1:3,441 --> 0:1:6,57
everything around her.

24
0:1:6,510 --> 0:1:9,165
After a moment of peace and quietness, she opened

25
0:1:9,165 --> 0:1:11,820
her blue eyes and looked over to the Aarons's

26
0:1:11,820 --> 0:1:14,475
house, basically Jess's room.

27
0:1:14,928 --> 0:1:16,554
"Maybe he's still sleeping..."

28
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:19,259
She mumbled to herself, seeing that the

29
0:1:19,259 --> 0:1:21,512
lights were still off in his room.

30
0:1:21,965 --> 0:1:24,543
After a while of watching the window she found herself to

31
0:1:24,543 --> 0:1:27,120
be feeling creepy so she stepped back and took a breath

32
0:1:27,120 --> 0:1:29,697
before going to her closet to get a new set of clothes to

33
0:1:29,697 --> 0:1:32,275
wear for today.

34
0:1:32,728 --> 0:1:35,515
As soon as she finished making her bed and tidying herself

35
0:1:35,515 --> 0:1:38,301
up, she slowly crept down the stairs and headed to the

36
0:1:38,301 --> 0:1:41,88
kitchen to have her breakfast.

37
0:1:41,541 --> 0:1:44,171
"Hey honey," she heard Judy's voice as she entered the

38
0:1:44,171 --> 0:1:46,800
living room, finding her mother sitting on the couch,

39
0:1:46,800 --> 0:1:49,430
drinking a cup of coffee while Bill was in the kitchen,

40
0:1:49,430 --> 0:1:52,60
making breakfast.

41
0:1:52,513 --> 0:1:53,279
"Good morning!"

42
0:1:53,733 --> 0:1:55,428
"Morning Judy, Bill."

43
0:1:55,882 --> 0:1:58,784
Leslie chirped as she went over to hug her before going to

44
0:1:58,784 --> 0:2:1,687
the kitchen and hugging Bill behind.

45
0:2:2,140 --> 0:2:3,487
"So did you sleep well?"

46
0:2:3,940 --> 0:2:6,193
Bill asked her with a chuckle as she took her

47
0:2:6,193 --> 0:2:8,445
seat behind the dining table, waiting for her

48
0:2:8,445 --> 0:2:10,697
breakfast to be done.

49
0:2:11,151 --> 0:2:12,660
"It was okay I guess."

50
0:2:13,114 --> 0:2:14,669
She shrugged her shoulders.

51
0:2:15,123 --> 0:2:17,584
Bill set her plate on the table and then went over to the

52
0:2:17,584 --> 0:2:20,46
living room to give Judy's hers.

53
0:2:20,499 --> 0:2:21,985
"The bed was really comfy!"

54
0:2:22,439 --> 0:2:23,902
She showed a goofy grin.

55
0:2:24,355 --> 0:2:26,282
"So is Jess coming over today?"

56
0:2:26,736 --> 0:2:28,698
Judy came to the kitchen with her breakfast

57
0:2:28,698 --> 0:2:30,660
and her coffee in her hands.

58
0:2:31,114 --> 0:2:33,203
She took a seat opposite to Leslie and

59
0:2:33,203 --> 0:2:35,293
started eating her breakfast.

60
0:2:35,747 --> 0:2:37,430
"Yeah," she said, stuffing in the

61
0:2:37,430 --> 0:2:39,114
pan cakes in her mouth.

62
0:2:39,567 --> 0:2:40,542
"He said he would."

63
0:2:40,996 --> 0:2:43,271
She continued after swallowing her food.

64
0:2:43,725 --> 0:2:46,163
The rest of their breakfast was lively and chatty, with

65
0:2:46,163 --> 0:2:48,601
laughter filling up the the table.

66
0:2:49,55 --> 0:2:51,493
"So what'd you do with Leslie yesterday?"

67
0:2:51,946 --> 0:2:54,71
May Belle excitedly asked her brother as

68
0:2:54,71 --> 0:2:56,195
their family ate their breakfast.

69
0:2:56,649 --> 0:2:59,598
"We went

70
0:2:59,598 --> 0:3:2,547
to..."

71
0:3:3,0 --> 0:3:5,113
He showed her the look, giving a grin.

72
0:3:5,567 --> 0:3:7,88
He couldn't let their parents

73
0:3:7,88 --> 0:3:8,609
know about it, ever.

74
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:10,989
It was just his, May Belle's and of

75
0:3:10,989 --> 0:3:12,917
course, Leslie's place.

76
0:3:13,370 --> 0:3:15,460
"So I'm guessing that Leslie girl is

77
0:3:15,460 --> 0:3:17,550
looking pretty," said Ellie, pouring

78
0:3:17,550 --> 0:3:19,640
Joyce Ann some milk in her bowl.

79
0:3:20,93 --> 0:3:21,835
"It was pretty clear that she'd turn into a

80
0:3:21,835 --> 0:3:23,576
beauty when we saw her."

81
0:3:24,30 --> 0:3:26,375
Brenda nodded her head along with a grin.

82
0:3:26,828 --> 0:3:29,11
Jess chocked on his own food, going into

83
0:3:29,11 --> 0:3:31,194
fits of cough, making him drink his glass

84
0:3:31,194 --> 0:3:33,376
of water finished.

85
0:3:33,830 --> 0:3:35,687
"Ooo Mommy! Jess is choking!"

86
0:3:36,141 --> 0:3:38,602
Joyce Ann pointed at his brother with a giggle.

87
0:3:39,56 --> 0:3:42,5
"Jess, eat your food properly," his mother said, patting her

88
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:44,954
son's back before handling her children's finished dishes

89
0:3:44,954 --> 0:3:47,903
and going to the sink to wash them.

90
0:3:48,356 --> 0:3:50,376
"You're going to Leslie's later right?"

91
0:3:50,830 --> 0:3:52,444
"Yeah," Jess laid his head down

92
0:3:52,444 --> 0:3:54,57
on the wooden table.

93
0:3:54,511 --> 0:3:55,579
"I can right?"

94
0:3:56,33 --> 0:3:56,683
"Sure."

95
0:3:57,136 --> 0:3:58,181
Said his mother.

96
0:3:58,635 --> 0:4:1,166
"Who's this Leslie? I wanna meet her!"

97
0:4:1,619 --> 0:4:2,734
Joyce Ann whined.

98
0:4:3,187 --> 0:4:4,987
Oh yeah, she never got to meet

99
0:4:4,987 --> 0:4:6,786
Leslie before in person.

100
0:4:7,240 --> 0:4:9,74
Maybe as a baby, but she was too young

101
0:4:9,74 --> 0:4:10,909
to even remember it.

102
0:4:11,362 --> 0:4:13,916
May Belle turned to her, rolling her eyes.

103
0:4:14,370 --> 0:4:17,330
She always didn't like Joyce Ann because now that she's grown

104
0:4:17,330 --> 0:4:20,291
older, Joyce Ann was their little girl now.

105
0:4:20,744 --> 0:4:22,556
"You can't meet her," she snickered.

106
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:24,983
"She doesn't

107
0:4:24,983 --> 0:4:26,956
want to."

108
0:4:27,410 --> 0:4:27,921
"What?"

109
0:4:28,374 --> 0:4:30,35
Joyce Ann got teary eyed once she

110
0:4:30,35 --> 0:4:31,695
heard May Belle's words.

111
0:4:32,148 --> 0:4:34,122
She turned to her mom with a pout.

112
0:4:34,575 --> 0:4:35,713
"Is that true mommy?"

113
0:4:36,167 --> 0:4:37,746
The siblings chuckled at their baby

114
0:4:37,746 --> 0:4:39,325
sister's innocent nature.

115
0:4:39,778 --> 0:4:42,472
Jess couldn't help but feel a bit pity for Joyce Ann

116
0:4:42,472 --> 0:4:45,165
since May Belle was so mean to her.

117
0:4:45,619 --> 0:4:47,523
"Of course not hunny," their mother said,

118
0:4:47,523 --> 0:4:49,427
caressing her daughter's cheek.

119
0:4:49,880 --> 0:4:51,459
"Leslie's a good girl. I'm

120
0:4:51,459 --> 0:4:53,38
sure she'll like you."

121
0:4:53,492 --> 0:4:55,373
Jess raised his head up and rested his chin on the palm of

122
0:4:55,373 --> 0:4:57,253
his hand as he looked at Joyce Ann.

123
0:4:57,707 --> 0:4:59,297
"May Belle's just kidding

124
0:4:59,297 --> 0:5:0,888
Joyce, Leslie loves kids."

125
0:5:1,342 --> 0:5:3,942
He gave her a reassuring smile as he got up from the table

126
0:5:3,942 --> 0:5:6,543
and went to Joyce Ann's side to give her a peck on her cheek

127
0:5:6,543 --> 0:5:9,143
and then ruffling May Belle's hair before heading

128
0:5:9,143 --> 0:5:11,744
towards the door.

129
0:5:12,198 --> 0:5:14,775
"I'll come back later, see ya guys."

130
0:5:15,229 --> 0:5:17,5
"Don't stay out too long, you still

131
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:18,781
have chores to do later."

132
0:5:19,235 --> 0:5:21,835
He heard his father's voice as he left the house.

133
0:5:22,289 --> 0:5:24,425
He quickly walked to the Burke's property,

134
0:5:24,425 --> 0:5:26,561
rushing to see Leslie again.

135
0:5:27,15 --> 0:5:28,222
Best friends right?

136
0:5:28,676 --> 0:5:30,359
A knock came upon the door, turning

137
0:5:30,359 --> 0:5:32,43
heads towards the entrance.

138
0:5:32,496 --> 0:5:33,750
"That must be Jess!"

139
0:5:34,204 --> 0:5:36,560
Leslie whispered sharply with excitement in her

140
0:5:36,560 --> 0:5:38,917
voice, getting up from the table.

141
0:5:39,371 --> 0:5:40,834
"Slow down lil girl!"

142
0:5:41,287 --> 0:5:42,924
She could hear Bill talking as she

143
0:5:42,924 --> 0:5:44,561
walked towards the door.

144
0:5:45,15 --> 0:5:47,855
She then opened the door, revealing Jess who had his hands

145
0:5:47,855 --> 0:5:50,696
behind his back as if he was trying to look formal and

146
0:5:50,696 --> 0:5:53,536
respectful for whatever reason.

147
0:5:53,990 --> 0:5:55,174
"What's the occasion?"

148
0:5:55,628 --> 0:5:58,368
She laughed, pulling him inside a moment later.

149
0:5:58,821 --> 0:6:0,841
Jess gladly let her lead him to the kitchen

150
0:6:0,841 --> 0:6:2,861
where the Burke's were likely at.

151
0:6:3,315 --> 0:6:4,546
"Good morning Jess."

152
0:6:4,999 --> 0:6:7,135
Bill greeted him with a small smile.

153
0:6:7,589 --> 0:6:10,282
Judy nodded her head and returned back to eating.

154
0:6:10,736 --> 0:6:13,81
"Good morning Bill," Jess said.

155
0:6:13,535 --> 0:6:15,984
He turned to Judy, unsure if he was supposed to

156
0:6:15,984 --> 0:6:18,434
call her Mrs Burke or just Judy.

157
0:6:18,887 --> 0:6:21,349
They rarely conversed with each other and when they

158
0:6:21,349 --> 0:6:23,810
did, it was just for a brief moment.

159
0:6:24,264 --> 0:6:26,679
Judy raised her head to him and smiled.

160
0:6:27,132 --> 0:6:28,223
"Judy," she said.

161
0:6:28,677 --> 0:6:30,465
" Just call me Judy, Jess."

162
0:6:30,918 --> 0:6:32,288
Jess nodded his head.

163
0:6:32,742 --> 0:6:33,833
"Good morning Judy."

164
0:6:34,287 --> 0:6:36,237
He couldn't help but blush when he called

165
0:6:36,237 --> 0:6:38,188
Leslie's mom by her first name.

166
0:6:38,641 --> 0:6:40,499
It just didn't sit right with him!

167
0:6:40,952 --> 0:6:42,729
Nevertheless, he continued with

168
0:6:42,729 --> 0:6:44,505
the informal greetings.

169
0:6:44,958 --> 0:6:45,655
"Come on!"

170
0:6:46,109 --> 0:6:49,23
Leslie grabbed his arm and ran

171
0:6:49,23 --> 0:6:51,937
to the door before Jess could

172
0:6:51,937 --> 0:6:54,851
even properly bid goodbye to

173
0:6:54,851 --> 0:6:57,765
the Burke's .

174
0:6:58,218 --> 0:7:0,850
They trailed along the stream, walking towards the path to

175
0:7:0,850 --> 0:7:3,482
Terabithia except this was a way that they had never gone to

176
0:7:3,482 --> 0:7:6,113
before when they were kids.

177
0:7:6,567 --> 0:7:8,378
"So where are we going today?"

178
0:7:8,831 --> 0:7:11,409
Leslie walked in front of him and then carefully

179
0:7:11,409 --> 0:7:13,986
jumped to the river and hopped onto the rocks,

180
0:7:13,986 --> 0:7:16,564
getting across the other side.

181
0:7:17,17 --> 0:7:19,61
Although the water wasn't rapid or that

182
0:7:19,61 --> 0:7:21,104
deep, it still looked risky enough to not

183
0:7:21,104 --> 0:7:23,147
dare to jump across.

184
0:7:23,601 --> 0:7:27,486
"It's

185
0:7:27,486 --> 0:7:31,372
a

186
0:7:31,372 --> 0:7:35,257
secret..."

187
0:7:35,711 --> 0:7:38,369
Jess whispered, trying to hide his fear from her as

188
0:7:38,369 --> 0:7:41,28
he tried to jump across as well.

189
0:7:41,482 --> 0:7:43,200
It wasn't that he was afraid.

190
0:7:43,653 --> 0:7:45,813
He had done this before, alone, when he

191
0:7:45,813 --> 0:7:47,972
was just wondering around.

192
0:7:48,426 --> 0:7:51,282
But now that Leslie was back, he was more cautious of things

193
0:7:51,282 --> 0:7:54,138
especially when it has something to do with her.

194
0:7:54,591 --> 0:7:56,782
He carefully jumped onto the rocks, skipping

195
0:7:56,782 --> 0:7:58,972
some along the way to quicken the time to get to the

196
0:7:58,972 --> 0:8:1,163
other side with Leslie.

197
0:8:1,616 --> 0:8:4,403
After doing so, he told Leslie to come along and ran

198
0:8:4,403 --> 0:8:7,189
towards the deeper ends of the forest.

199
0:8:7,642 --> 0:8:9,663
In a minute or so, they arrived at a foot of

200
0:8:9,663 --> 0:8:11,683
a huge tree where an old tree house could

201
0:8:11,683 --> 0:8:13,703
be seen on it.

202
0:8:14,156 --> 0:8:16,896
Near the tree house were ropes to climb to get up from

203
0:8:16,896 --> 0:8:19,636
below and climb up to the tree house.

204
0:8:20,90 --> 0:8:22,952
The most noticeable thing was that even though the house

205
0:8:22,952 --> 0:8:25,814
itself looked old, there was a sign at the front where it had the

206
0:8:25,814 --> 0:8:28,675
words painted - 'nothing crushes us' and had a painting of

207
0:8:28,675 --> 0:8:31,537
swords and shields on it.

208
0:8:31,991 --> 0:8:32,873
"What's this?"

209
0:8:33,327 --> 0:8:35,788
Leslie showed him a confused expression.

210
0:8:36,241 --> 0:8:39,28
Jess went closer to the tree and then took the rope,

211
0:8:39,28 --> 0:8:41,814
gesturing for her to take it so she can go up.

212
0:8:42,268 --> 0:8:44,323
Leslie crinkled her nose and then shook her

213
0:8:44,323 --> 0:8:46,378
head, pushing away the rope.

214
0:8:46,831 --> 0:8:48,573
"I'll climb it up myself."

215
0:8:49,26 --> 0:8:49,560
"Really?"

216
0:8:50,14 --> 0:8:51,964
"What's the matter? It's just climbing."

217
0:8:52,418 --> 0:8:54,600
She started climbing up, ignoring the dirt

218
0:8:54,600 --> 0:8:56,783
that was dirtying her clothes.

219
0:8:57,237 --> 0:8:59,412
As she reached the end and went to the tree house

220
0:8:59,412 --> 0:9:1,587
itself, Jess followed behind by using his

221
0:9:1,587 --> 0:9:3,761
usual route - the rope.

222
0:9:4,215 --> 0:9:5,330
"Is this yours?"

223
0:9:5,783 --> 0:9:8,12
She asked as they came into the room.

224
0:9:8,466 --> 0:9:11,426
"Ours actually," Jess corrected her, leaning on the

225
0:9:11,426 --> 0:9:14,387
wall as she continued to look around.

226
0:9:14,840 --> 0:9:16,547
He blushed when Leslie picked up

227
0:9:16,547 --> 0:9:18,254
his teddy bear, blue.

228
0:9:18,707 --> 0:9:20,449
"That-that was actually yours-"

229
0:9:20,902 --> 0:9:23,729
Leslie looked back at him and then giggled, "I may not

230
0:9:23,729 --> 0:9:26,556
remember Terabithia, but I still do remember what I

231
0:9:26,556 --> 0:9:29,383
owned and liked," she placed the toy on top of her head

232
0:9:29,383 --> 0:9:32,210
and fiddled with it.

233
0:9:32,664 --> 0:9:34,220
"Besides, it's really cute!"

234
0:9:34,673 --> 0:9:37,645
Jess blushed as they continued to walk around the room.

235
0:9:38,99 --> 0:9:40,548
Leslie suddenly laughed as she looked at the drawings that

236
0:9:40,548 --> 0:9:42,998
she and Jess made when they were younger.

237
0:9:43,452 --> 0:9:46,134
"I was such a goof back then," she giggled, staring at her

238
0:9:46,134 --> 0:9:48,815
drawings and then looking at Jess's.

239
0:9:49,269 --> 0:9:51,34
"So what happened to your drawings?

240
0:9:51,34 --> 0:9:52,798
Have you made any progress?"

241
0:9:53,252 --> 0:9:55,574
Jess blushed and shrugged his shoulders.

242
0:9:56,27 --> 0:9:58,512
"I don't know," he scratched his cheek.

243
0:9:58,965 --> 0:10:0,626
"I have some drawings that I made a few

244
0:10:0,626 --> 0:10:2,286
months ago in my room."

245
0:10:2,739 --> 0:10:4,841
Leslie grinned at him, "you better show

246
0:10:4,841 --> 0:10:6,942
'em to me later after this."

247
0:10:7,396 --> 0:10:10,124
She continued scanning around the room and noticed a

248
0:10:10,124 --> 0:10:12,852
paper that didn't seem familiar to her.

249
0:10:13,306 --> 0:10:16,220
"Okay I know that

250
0:10:16,220 --> 0:10:19,134
I'm not really

251
0:10:19,134 --> 0:10:22,48
good at drawing

252
0:10:22,48 --> 0:10:24,962
but..."

253
0:10:25,416 --> 0:10:26,925
She pointed to the paper and

254
0:10:26,925 --> 0:10:28,435
wore a confused face.

255
0:10:28,888 --> 0:10:31,802
"I'm sure that

256
0:10:31,802 --> 0:10:34,716
my drawing

257
0:10:34,716 --> 0:10:37,630
isn't this...

258
0:10:37,630 --> 0:10:40,544
Well..."

259
0:10:40,998 --> 0:10:43,784
"Kiddish like it was drawn by a 7 yr old?"

260
0:10:44,238 --> 0:10:45,817
He cut her off with a chuckle.

261
0:10:46,270 --> 0:10:49,161
He walked to her and then traced his fingers along the drawing and

262
0:10:49,161 --> 0:10:52,52
then pointed with his thumb to a wooden box.

263
0:10:52,506 --> 0:10:54,688
"May Belle drew it," he got down and then

264
0:10:54,688 --> 0:10:56,871
took a magnifying glass out of the box and

265
0:10:56,871 --> 0:10:59,54
handed it over to her.

266
0:10:59,507 --> 0:11:1,597
She raised her eye brow in question before

267
0:11:1,597 --> 0:11:3,687
taking it from him and placing it to her eye and

268
0:11:3,687 --> 0:11:5,777
analyzing the drawing.

269
0:11:6,230 --> 0:11:7,484
"Drawn by May belle..."

270
0:11:7,937 --> 0:11:9,424
She read out quietly.

271
0:11:9,877 --> 0:11:12,849
A small smile grew on her lips, placing the

272
0:11:12,849 --> 0:11:15,821
magnifying glass on top of the wooden box.

273
0:11:16,275 --> 0:11:18,98
Jess looked at her uneasily as he

274
0:11:18,98 --> 0:11:19,920
ruffled his brown hair.

275
0:11:20,374 --> 0:11:21,651
"You're not mad are you?"

276
0:11:22,105 --> 0:11:23,892
"Mad?"

277
0:11:24,346 --> 0:11:26,784
Her tone as if surprised by his question.

278
0:11:27,238 --> 0:11:28,491
"Why would I be mad?"

279
0:11:28,945 --> 0:11:30,605
She put her hands behind her back and

280
0:11:30,605 --> 0:11:32,265
walked out of the room.

281
0:11:32,719 --> 0:11:34,356
Jess slowly walked behind her

282
0:11:34,356 --> 0:11:35,993
and leaned on the wall.

283
0:11:36,446 --> 0:11:39,163
"Well..."

284
0:11:39,617 --> 0:11:42,264
He trailed off as his eyes looked around the forest,

285
0:11:42,264 --> 0:11:44,911
trying to think of an excuse to say.

286
0:11:45,364 --> 0:11:48,499
"I

287
0:11:48,499 --> 0:11:51,634
don't

288
0:11:51,634 --> 0:11:54,768
know..."

289
0:11:55,222 --> 0:11:57,730
Leslie looked back at him with a goofy grin.

290
0:11:58,183 --> 0:12:0,443
"The more the merrier right? Can't believe

291
0:12:0,443 --> 0:12:2,703
you'd think that I'd be angry about this," she

292
0:12:2,703 --> 0:12:4,963
said in a jokingly manner.

293
0:12:5,417 --> 0:12:8,134
She looked at the ground and stared at it for a while.

294
0:12:8,587 --> 0:12:11,2
There was a moment of silence as she thought.

295
0:12:11,456 --> 0:12:14,381
Finally, Jess asked her, "what are you doing?"

296
0:12:14,835 --> 0:12:17,563
"Can you actually jump from here and land safely to the

297
0:12:17,563 --> 0:12:20,292
ground with the Terabithia Magic?"

298
0:12:20,745 --> 0:12:22,881
She asked without turning around.

299
0:12:23,335 --> 0:12:25,204
Jess started walking over to her, still

300
0:12:25,204 --> 0:12:27,73
confused by her question.

301
0:12:27,527 --> 0:12:29,570
"Well

302
0:12:29,570 --> 0:12:31,613
yeah

303
0:12:31,613 --> 0:12:33,657
but.."

304
0:12:34,110 --> 0:12:36,978
Before he could even finish, Leslie decided to do the most

305
0:12:36,978 --> 0:12:39,846
stupidest thing that could be done at the moment.

306
0:12:40,299 --> 0:12:42,939
Without another second thought, she jumped from the

307
0:12:42,939 --> 0:12:45,578
tree house, Jess's eyes widening in shock as he

308
0:12:45,578 --> 0:12:48,217
watched her escape from his sight.

309
0:12:48,671 --> 0:12:54,499


310
0:12:54,499 --> 0:13:0,327
"Leslie-!"

311
0:13:0,781 --> 0:13:3,451
He immediately jumped to the edge to see if she was

312
0:13:3,451 --> 0:13:6,121
alright, injured, or even worse.

313
0:13:6,575 --> 0:13:8,955
His eyes darted over to the blonde girl who was

314
0:13:8,955 --> 0:13:11,335
smiling at him with her arms wide open.

315
0:13:11,788 --> 0:13:13,948
The 2 best friends walked to the bridge, chatting away happily with laughter filling up the place.

316
0:13:14,401 --> 0:13:15,864
She finally remembered.

317
0:13:16,318 --> 0:13:17,757
She remembered Terabithia.

318
0:13:18,211 --> 0:13:20,45
"You almost gave me a heart attack

319
0:13:20,45 --> 0:13:21,880
you know," Jess joked.

320
0:13:22,333 --> 0:13:23,471
"That was my plan."

321
0:13:23,924 --> 0:13:25,759
Leslie laughed as she playfully

322
0:13:25,759 --> 0:13:27,593
pushed him away with one hand.

323
0:13:28,47 --> 0:13:30,148
They continued with their playful antics to each

324
0:13:30,148 --> 0:13:32,249
other before arriving to the bridge.

325
0:13:32,703 --> 0:13:35,489
As they walked over to the bridge, a thunder roared

326
0:13:35,489 --> 0:13:38,276
across the sky, making them both look up.

327
0:13:38,729 --> 0:13:41,469
The clouds were getting darker and darker by the second and the

328
0:13:41,469 --> 0:13:44,209
wind was getting chillier and chillier.

329
0:13:44,663 --> 0:13:47,321
Jess looked over at Leslie who seemed to be feeling colder

330
0:13:47,321 --> 0:13:49,980
by the minute as she cuddled herself.

331
0:13:50,434 --> 0:13:53,110
He was wearing a jacket, just in case if the situation

332
0:13:53,110 --> 0:13:55,786
ever ends up like this but Leslie, she was wearing her

333
0:13:55,786 --> 0:13:58,462
usual eccentric style of clothing, except that her

334
0:13:58,462 --> 0:14:1,138
jacket was missing.

335
0:14:1,592 --> 0:14:4,111
He then went behind her and took off his jacket, wrapping

336
0:14:4,111 --> 0:14:6,630
it around her shivering shoulders.

337
0:14:7,84 --> 0:14:9,11
Leslie gave him a questioning look before

338
0:14:9,11 --> 0:14:10,938
reluctantly using his jacket.

339
0:14:11,392 --> 0:14:12,924
"Thanks," she smiled.

340
0:14:13,378 --> 0:14:14,516
"But what about you?"

341
0:14:14,969 --> 0:14:17,94
Jess started walking forward, "I'm a

342
0:14:17,94 --> 0:14:19,218
guy, this is nothing to me."

343
0:14:19,672 --> 0:14:22,551
Before they even knew it, rain drops started coming

344
0:14:22,551 --> 0:14:25,430
down, and soon the heavy rain came after.

345
0:14:25,884 --> 0:14:28,276
They dashed across the bridge and then to the hills,

346
0:14:28,276 --> 0:14:30,667
and later arriving at the road.

347
0:14:31,121 --> 0:14:33,172
To be fair, the Aarons's house were nearer

348
0:14:33,172 --> 0:14:35,223
so they decided to head back to Jess's place

349
0:14:35,223 --> 0:14:37,274
together instead.

350
0:14:37,728 --> 0:14:39,852
Jess shook his head vigorously as he let the

351
0:14:39,852 --> 0:14:41,977
water fall from his hair.

352
0:14:42,430 --> 0:14:44,520
He took off his shoes and placed them to the shoe

353
0:14:44,520 --> 0:14:46,610
box before opening the door.

354
0:14:47,63 --> 0:14:48,596
Leslie did the same thing and

355
0:14:48,596 --> 0:14:50,128
then entered his house.

356
0:14:50,582 --> 0:14:51,882
"You're back so soon?"

357
0:14:52,336 --> 0:14:53,845
They heard Ellie's voice.

358
0:14:54,299 --> 0:14:56,806
She peered over her shoulder and looked at Jess,

359
0:14:56,806 --> 0:14:59,314
not noticing Leslie's presence.

360
0:14:59,768 --> 0:15:1,161
"Dry yourself up dude."

361
0:15:1,614 --> 0:15:3,182
She rolled her eyes and went back

362
0:15:3,182 --> 0:15:4,749
to watching the TV.

363
0:15:5,203 --> 0:15:7,838
Leslie looked at Jess with an eye brow raised before

364
0:15:7,838 --> 0:15:10,474
whispering, "does she know I'm here?"

365
0:15:10,927 --> 0:15:13,481
Jess looked at her and shrugged his shoulders.

366
0:15:13,935 --> 0:15:16,466
In a minute or so, realization hit Ellie.

367
0:15:16,919 --> 0:15:18,765
She looked back at them with eyes wide open

368
0:15:18,765 --> 0:15:20,611
before looking at Leslie.

369
0:15:21,65 --> 0:15:22,63
"Oh you're here!"

370
0:15:22,517 --> 0:15:23,190
"Who's here?"

371
0:15:23,644 --> 0:15:25,443
They heard Jess's mom, Mary, speak all

372
0:15:25,443 --> 0:15:27,243
the way from the kitchen.

373
0:15:27,696 --> 0:15:29,310
A few seconds later, she came out

374
0:15:29,310 --> 0:15:30,924
and approached them.

375
0:15:31,377 --> 0:15:32,329
"Oh, Leslie!"

376
0:15:32,783 --> 0:15:35,221
Ellie, just then noticing that they were both

377
0:15:35,221 --> 0:15:37,659
soaking wet, jumped up to her feet and went to her

378
0:15:37,659 --> 0:15:40,97
bedroom to get some stuff.

379
0:15:40,551 --> 0:15:42,199
"My you 2 are dripping wet!"

380
0:15:42,653 --> 0:15:44,812
Mary ushered them to the couch, not

381
0:15:44,812 --> 0:15:46,972
giving a care if it'd get wet.

382
0:15:47,425 --> 0:15:49,260
Ellie then rushed down from the stairs

383
0:15:49,260 --> 0:15:51,94
with 2 towels in her hand.

384
0:15:51,547 --> 0:15:54,508
She threw the blue one over to Jess and gently handed over the

385
0:15:54,508 --> 0:15:57,469
red one to Leslie before going back up.

386
0:15:57,922 --> 0:16:0,418
As Leslie took off Jess's jacket, she walked

387
0:16:0,418 --> 0:16:2,914
around shyly and then looked at Mary.

388
0:16:3,368 --> 0:16:4,761
"Where should I put this mam?"

389
0:16:5,215 --> 0:16:6,654
She asked politely.

390
0:16:7,108 --> 0:16:9,910
"Just put it over the rack Leslie," Mary responded with a

391
0:16:9,910 --> 0:16:12,711
small smile as she dialed the Burke's to make sure they knew

392
0:16:12,711 --> 0:16:15,513
that Leslie was at their place.

393
0:16:15,967 --> 0:16:18,881
"Yes hello, this is Mrs

394
0:16:18,881 --> 0:16:21,795
Aarons- Mary. Yes, I'm

395
0:16:21,795 --> 0:16:24,709
just calling to inform

396
0:16:24,709 --> 0:16:27,623
you that..."

397
0:16:28,77 --> 0:16:30,399
Leslie returned back to Jess's side after

398
0:16:30,399 --> 0:16:32,721
putting his jacket on the racket.

399
0:16:33,174 --> 0:16:34,951
She looked at the window, looking at

400
0:16:34,951 --> 0:16:36,727
how heavy the rain was.

401
0:16:37,180 --> 0:16:38,771
Didn't seem like she was going to go

402
0:16:38,771 --> 0:16:40,362
home any sooner now.

403
0:16:40,815 --> 0:16:43,718
"Hey mom, Joyce needs some help with her assignment about

404
0:16:43,718 --> 0:16:46,620
some family history or something..."

405
0:16:47,74 --> 0:16:48,653
They could hear Brenda speaking as

406
0:16:48,653 --> 0:16:50,232
she went down the stairs.

407
0:16:50,685 --> 0:16:52,953
She looked over to Jess and then to Leslie before

408
0:16:52,953 --> 0:16:55,221
looking at her mom who was over the phone and then

409
0:16:55,221 --> 0:16:57,488
to Leslie again.

410
0:16:57,942 --> 0:16:58,383
"Oh."

411
0:16:58,837 --> 0:16:59,789
She mouthed.

412
0:17:0,242 --> 0:17:1,972
She gave Leslie a warm smile before

413
0:17:1,972 --> 0:17:3,702
quickly going back up.

414
0:17:4,156 --> 0:17:6,547
It just felt weird for a girl that was

415
0:17:6,547 --> 0:17:8,939
Jess's age to be in the house.

416
0:17:9,392 --> 0:17:11,320
"Yes,

417
0:17:11,320 --> 0:17:13,247
okay-"

418
0:17:13,700 --> 0:17:15,349
Mary put down the phone and then

419
0:17:15,349 --> 0:17:16,998
turned to Jess and Leslie.

420
0:17:17,451 --> 0:17:19,436
"You kids can take a bath upstairs," she

421
0:17:19,436 --> 0:17:21,422
went back to the phone again.

422
0:17:21,875 --> 0:17:24,383
Both of them took Mary's word and headed upstairs with

423
0:17:24,383 --> 0:17:26,891
the towels wrapped around their body.

424
0:17:27,344 --> 0:17:30,131
As they came into the hallway of the rooms, Leslie

425
0:17:30,131 --> 0:17:32,917
asked Jess, "so who's going first?"

426
0:17:33,371 --> 0:17:34,857
Jess headed for his room.

427
0:17:35,310 --> 0:17:37,52
"You go. Ladies first right?"

428
0:17:37,505 --> 0:17:40,477
He smirked before opening the door and then entering it.

429
0:17:40,931 --> 0:17:43,392
Leslie smiled at him and then headed to the bathroom,

430
0:17:43,392 --> 0:17:45,853
closing it and then locking it later.

431
0:17:46,307 --> 0:17:48,513
Jess collapsed to his bed, ignoring how

432
0:17:48,513 --> 0:17:50,719
wet his bed would be later.

433
0:17:51,172 --> 0:17:52,867
He stared at at the ceiling, his towel

434
0:17:52,867 --> 0:17:54,562
draped around his neck.

435
0:17:55,16 --> 0:17:57,767
Who would've thought, that a girl, Leslie for that matter,

436
0:17:57,767 --> 0:18:0,519
was going to take a SHOWER in his house!

437
0:18:0,973 --> 0:18:3,295
Sure, they've slept together when they were kids

438
0:18:3,295 --> 0:18:5,617
at the tree house in Terabithia before since they

439
0:18:5,617 --> 0:18:7,939
were still innocent little kids but now, they're

440
0:18:7,939 --> 0:18:10,261
all grown up.

441
0:18:10,714 --> 0:18:11,457
Mature.

442
0:18:11,911 --> 0:18:13,72
At that phase.

443
0:18:13,525 --> 0:18:16,172
"Oh lord you seriously have to stop it Jess!"

444
0:18:16,626 --> 0:18:18,298
He hissed darkly, pulling his

445
0:18:18,298 --> 0:18:19,969
hair in frustration.

446
0:18:20,423 --> 0:18:22,977
He sat up and looked at the door, any moment now she could

447
0:18:22,977 --> 0:18:25,531
just come in with whatever she's going to wear with her

448
0:18:25,531 --> 0:18:28,85
dripping wet and all.

449
0:18:28,539 --> 0:18:29,955
What is he talking about, girls take VERY long in the bathroom...

450
0:18:30,409 --> 0:18:32,545
He let out a sigh and then got up, going to the small box he had underneath his study table.

451
0:18:32,999 --> 0:18:35,88
Leslie slowly took off her clothes and put

452
0:18:35,88 --> 0:18:37,178
them on the racket near the tub.

453
0:18:37,632 --> 0:18:40,407
As she turned on the shower, water droplets dropped,

454
0:18:40,407 --> 0:18:43,181
sliding on her smooth and frail skin.

455
0:18:43,635 --> 0:18:46,526
She closed her eyes as she felt the small drops sliding off,

456
0:18:46,526 --> 0:18:49,417
her hair getting wetter and wetter.

457
0:18:49,870 --> 0:18:50,520
"Leslie?"

458
0:18:50,974 --> 0:18:52,878
She heard a knock coming from the door.

459
0:18:53,331 --> 0:18:55,50
She looked over to the door and then

460
0:18:55,50 --> 0:18:56,768
closed the curtains.

461
0:18:57,221 --> 0:18:57,872
"Yes?"

462
0:18:58,325 --> 0:19:1,320
"It's me Ellie. I just came to drop you off some old

463
0:19:1,320 --> 0:19:4,316
clothes of mine, can I come in?"

464
0:19:4,769 --> 0:19:7,544
Leslie turned off the shower and then wrapped the towel

465
0:19:7,544 --> 0:19:10,319
around her body before unlocking the door.

466
0:19:10,772 --> 0:19:13,222
Ellie quickly went in and then locked the door before

467
0:19:13,222 --> 0:19:15,672
placing the set of clothes near the sink.

468
0:19:16,125 --> 0:19:16,776
"Thank you."

469
0:19:17,229 --> 0:19:19,656
Leslie wore a smile before going into the shower

470
0:19:19,656 --> 0:19:22,82
and then taking off he towel.

471
0:19:22,536 --> 0:19:25,392
She put her arm out with the

472
0:19:25,392 --> 0:19:28,248
towel in her hand, "can you

473
0:19:28,248 --> 0:19:31,104
erm..."

474
0:19:31,557 --> 0:19:33,972
"I got it," Ellie responded and took the towel,

475
0:19:33,972 --> 0:19:36,387
putting it back to the rack again.

476
0:19:36,840 --> 0:19:39,383
As she did so, she looked over to Leslie, a

477
0:19:39,383 --> 0:19:41,926
thought appearing in her mind.

478
0:19:42,379 --> 0:19:44,852
"Say, we have this sort of Aaron's tradition

479
0:19:44,852 --> 0:19:47,325
and," a smirk grew on her lips.

480
0:19:47,779 --> 0:19:50,135
"We scrub the girls' back when we're taking a bath,

481
0:19:50,135 --> 0:19:52,492
it's a family tradition for girls."

482
0:19:52,946 --> 0:19:54,455
Ellie pushed aside the curtain

483
0:19:54,455 --> 0:19:55,964
and went behind Leslie.

484
0:19:56,418 --> 0:19:59,158
"Hope you don't mind," she grabbed the scrub.

485
0:19:59,611 --> 0:20:1,562
A sharp gasp escaped Ellie's lips when

486
0:20:1,562 --> 0:20:3,512
she looked at Leslie's back.

487
0:20:3,966 --> 0:20:7,851


488
0:20:7,851 --> 0:20:11,737
"Leslie...

489
0:20:11,737 --> 0:20:15,622
You-"

490
0:20:16,76 --> 0:20:21,904
"I

491
0:20:21,904 --> 0:20:27,732
know..."

492
0:20:28,186 --> 0:20:30,183
Leslie peered over her shoulder and

493
0:20:30,183 --> 0:20:32,179
looked at Ellie with a sad smile.

494
0:20:32,633 --> 0:20:34,723
"Don't tell anyone, please?"

495
0:20:35,176 --> 0:20:36,941
The door opened, making Jess

496
0:20:36,941 --> 0:20:38,706
immediately turn to the door.

497
0:20:39,159 --> 0:20:41,737
Leslie then entered his room, wearing an

498
0:20:41,737 --> 0:20:44,314
oversized red T-shirt that Ellie wore last time

499
0:20:44,314 --> 0:20:46,891
and a rather very SHORT shorts.

500
0:20:47,345 --> 0:20:49,737
Her towel was hanging around her neck, her hair

501
0:20:49,737 --> 0:20:52,128
still a bit wet from the shower.

502
0:20:52,582 --> 0:20:54,625
"Guess I hogged up the bathroom huh."

503
0:20:55,79 --> 0:20:57,865
She chuckled as she walked around his room and looked at the

504
0:20:57,865 --> 0:21:0,651
furniture and the stuff on his wall.

505
0:21:1,105 --> 0:21:2,916
Jess shook his head and then ruffled

506
0:21:2,916 --> 0:21:4,727
his almost dry wet hair.

507
0:21:5,181 --> 0:21:7,665
"Well you were

508
0:21:7,665 --> 0:21:10,150
certainly

509
0:21:10,150 --> 0:21:12,634
long..."

510
0:21:13,88 --> 0:21:15,50
He trailed and got up from his bed,

511
0:21:15,50 --> 0:21:17,12
heading out to the bathroom.

512
0:21:17,466 --> 0:21:19,660
He looked at Leslie again who was comfortably

513
0:21:19,660 --> 0:21:21,854
walking around and touching his stuff.

514
0:21:22,308 --> 0:21:23,353
He didn't mind.

515
0:21:23,806 --> 0:21:25,397
At least if it's Leslie

516
0:21:25,397 --> 0:21:26,987
touching them that is.

517
0:21:27,441 --> 0:21:29,592
As Leslie walked around the room, looking

518
0:21:29,592 --> 0:21:31,744
at his furniture, Jess slowly closed the

519
0:21:31,744 --> 0:21:33,896
door and then left.

520
0:21:34,349 --> 0:21:37,136
She peered over her shoulder to make sure that he was gone

521
0:21:37,136 --> 0:21:39,922
before going to his bed and lying on it.

522
0:21:40,376 --> 0:21:46,204


523
0:21:46,204 --> 0:21:52,32
"Wow..."

524
0:21:52,486 --> 0:21:53,438
She sighed.

525
0:21:53,891 --> 0:21:55,958
It made her feel weird lying down on his

526
0:21:55,958 --> 0:21:58,24
bed, much less a BOY's bed.

527
0:21:58,478 --> 0:22:1,473
Ew don't think about such things, he's your best friend!

528
0:22:1,927 --> 0:22:3,808
She rolled her eyes and then looked up to the

529
0:22:3,808 --> 0:22:5,688
ceiling and then sat up.

530
0:22:6,142 --> 0:22:8,278
She looked at the walls, noticing that there were

531
0:22:8,278 --> 0:22:10,414
quite an amount of drawings on it.

532
0:22:10,868 --> 0:22:13,759
The only thing that seemed to change in Jess's room was that there

533
0:22:13,759 --> 0:22:16,650
was a couple of rock bands posters on it.

534
0:22:17,103 --> 0:22:18,659
As she looked around, a small

535
0:22:18,659 --> 0:22:20,215
book got her attention.

536
0:22:20,668 --> 0:22:22,793
She got up and then walked to his study table

537
0:22:22,793 --> 0:22:24,917
where the small book was.

538
0:22:25,371 --> 0:22:26,578
It seemed familiar.

539
0:22:27,32 --> 0:22:29,528
She took the dusty book and opened it, making

540
0:22:29,528 --> 0:22:32,24
the dust waft into her face.

541
0:22:32,478 --> 0:22:34,428
"Ehem, ehem," she grunted as she

542
0:22:34,428 --> 0:22:36,379
tried to clear my throat.

543
0:22:36,832 --> 0:22:37,691
What the heck?

544
0:22:38,145 --> 0:22:39,840
Why is this so dusty?

545
0:22:40,293 --> 0:22:42,163
She looked at the page and saw drawings,

546
0:22:42,163 --> 0:22:44,32
very creative drawings.

547
0:22:44,485 --> 0:22:47,457
She flipped some more and found that as the more she went

548
0:22:47,457 --> 0:22:50,430
deeper, the drawings were becoming sketches.

549
0:22:50,883 --> 0:22:53,437
From weird creative drawings to more realism.

550
0:22:53,891 --> 0:22:56,445
She finally turned to the last page, finding a

551
0:22:56,445 --> 0:22:58,999
realism drawing, a very good one of a girl with short

552
0:22:58,999 --> 0:23:1,553
hair who looked like her.

553
0:23:2,7 --> 0:23:4,81
"Is

554
0:23:4,81 --> 0:23:6,156
this

555
0:23:6,156 --> 0:23:8,230
me...?"

556
0:23:8,683 --> 0:23:9,728
Leslie mumbled.

557
0:23:10,182 --> 0:23:12,899
She set the book down and looked at the walls again.

558
0:23:13,352 --> 0:23:15,976
Her eyes found itself looking at that one drawing where it

559
0:23:15,976 --> 0:23:18,600
seemed like color pencils were used.

560
0:23:19,53 --> 0:23:21,73
It was a tree house drawing, their tree

561
0:23:21,73 --> 0:23:23,94
house household on Terabithia!

562
0:23:23,547 --> 0:23:25,846
She smiled as she looked at the rest of his things when

563
0:23:25,846 --> 0:23:28,145
suddenly she heard the door open.

564
0:23:28,598 --> 0:23:30,549
"Took you long," she chuckled,

565
0:23:30,549 --> 0:23:32,499
approaching the wet haired Jess.

566
0:23:32,953 --> 0:23:35,275
"I thought boys were suppose to be fast."

567
0:23:35,728 --> 0:23:37,632
Jess dried his hair up with the towel,

568
0:23:37,632 --> 0:23:39,536
"you took longer you know."

569
0:23:39,990 --> 0:23:42,405
He grinned as he walked to his bed and sat on it

570
0:23:42,405 --> 0:23:44,819
while Leslie went to the study table and sat on

571
0:23:44,819 --> 0:23:47,234
the office chair.

572
0:23:47,688 --> 0:23:49,801
"So what happened to Ms Edmunds?"

573
0:23:50,254 --> 0:23:52,762
Leslie suddenly asked.

574
0:23:53,216 --> 0:23:55,584
Jess stared at her with a puzzled face.

575
0:23:56,38 --> 0:23:57,454
Why suddenly the question?

576
0:23:57,908 --> 0:24:0,578
"She married some guy and moved to New York..."

577
0:24:1,31 --> 0:24:3,516
He closed his eyes and folded his arms.

578
0:24:3,969 --> 0:24:5,270
"She has a kid now."

579
0:24:5,723 --> 0:24:8,115
Leslie raised her eye brow and then smirked.

580
0:24:8,568 --> 0:24:11,227
"Bet that you got jealous when you heard that she got married

581
0:24:11,227 --> 0:24:13,886
huh," she chuckled and then leaned forward.

582
0:24:14,339 --> 0:24:16,650
"I still remember how you stared at her in class as if she

583
0:24:16,650 --> 0:24:18,960
was some goddess or something."

584
0:24:19,414 --> 0:24:21,534
A blush crept to Jess's cheeks as Leslie

585
0:24:21,534 --> 0:24:23,655
continued teasing him about his crush

586
0:24:23,655 --> 0:24:25,776
with the music teacher.

587
0:24:26,229 --> 0:24:28,702
"You were just staring at her like some creepy kid while the

588
0:24:28,702 --> 0:24:31,175
rest of us were getting the instruments!"

589
0:24:31,629 --> 0:24:33,602
She laughed and then tried to make a face that

590
0:24:33,602 --> 0:24:35,576
Jess was wearing at the time.

591
0:24:36,30 --> 0:24:38,433
"You told me that that time to take a picture cause

592
0:24:38,433 --> 0:24:40,836
it'd last longer," Jess grinned.

593
0:24:41,290 --> 0:24:44,285
He then looked over his shoulder and looked at his pillow.

594
0:24:44,739 --> 0:24:47,525
Just for fun, he took the pillow and then showed a

595
0:24:47,525 --> 0:24:50,311
mischievous face before throwing it to her face.

596
0:24:50,765 --> 0:24:52,65
"Pillow fight Les!"

597
0:24:52,519 --> 0:24:54,353
"What-" she yelped as the pillow hit her.

598
0:24:54,807 --> 0:24:56,780
A big smile grew on her lips.

599
0:24:57,234 --> 0:25:0,206
She got up to her feet and then grabbed the pillow, running to Jess

600
0:25:0,206 --> 0:25:3,178
before hitting him with it relentlessly.

601
0:25:3,632 --> 0:25:4,514
"Ha ha ha!"

602
0:25:4,967 --> 0:25:7,661
She laughed as she hit him straight in the face.

603
0:25:8,115 --> 0:25:9,752
Jess smirked at her and then shoved

604
0:25:9,752 --> 0:25:11,389
the pillow to her face.

605
0:25:11,842 --> 0:25:15,728


606
0:25:15,728 --> 0:25:19,613
"Got

607
0:25:19,613 --> 0:25:23,498
ya!"

608
0:25:23,952 --> 0:25:25,949
Leslie leaned on him and then smacked him

609
0:25:25,949 --> 0:25:27,946
with the pillow for payback.

610
0:25:28,399 --> 0:25:30,797
As Jess leaned back, he unintentionally

611
0:25:30,797 --> 0:25:33,194
grabbed Leslie's wrist and pulled her down

612
0:25:33,194 --> 0:25:35,592
to him, making them both lie in bed on top of

613
0:25:35,592 --> 0:25:37,989
each other.

614
0:25:38,443 --> 0:25:40,780
The fits of laughter died down and instead,

615
0:25:40,780 --> 0:25:43,118
there was a moment of silence, though Leslie

616
0:25:43,118 --> 0:25:45,455
was wearing a small smile.

617
0:25:45,909 --> 0:25:48,335
Jess stared at Leslie's blue green orbs,

618
0:25:48,335 --> 0:25:50,762
completely taken away by the moment.

619
0:25:51,215 --> 0:25:53,200
He could smell her strawberry scent shampoo,

620
0:25:53,200 --> 0:25:55,186
her breath touching his skin.

621
0:25:55,639 --> 0:25:57,822
He was too afraid to even breathe, fearing

622
0:25:57,822 --> 0:26:0,5
that it might ruin the moment.

623
0:26:0,458 --> 0:26:1,619
Wait what moment?

624
0:26:2,73 --> 0:26:4,58
Their lips were just a few inches apart and

625
0:26:4,58 --> 0:26:6,43
they just couldn't move.

626
0:26:6,497 --> 0:26:12,325


627
0:26:12,325 --> 0:26:18,153
"Leslie-!"

628
0:26:18,607 --> 0:26:21,323
The door opened ever so loudly, revealing May

629
0:26:21,323 --> 0:26:24,40
Belle with a big smile on her face.

630
0:26:24,494 --> 0:26:26,734
That is until she saw the position of the 2

631
0:26:26,734 --> 0:26:28,975
favorite people she looks up to.

632
0:26:29,429 --> 0:26:32,180
Leslie stuck her tongue out before pushing herself off of

633
0:26:32,180 --> 0:26:34,932
Jess upon seeing May Belle's appearance.

634
0:26:35,385 --> 0:26:36,384
"Hey May Belle!"

635
0:26:36,837 --> 0:26:39,136
She beamed, clearing her throat.

636
0:26:39,590 --> 0:26:41,505
She averted Jess's gaze and got up,

637
0:26:41,505 --> 0:26:43,421
walking to May Belle.

638
0:26:43,874 --> 0:26:45,511
Jess continued staring at Leslie

639
0:26:45,511 --> 0:26:47,148
before shaking his head.

640
0:26:47,602 --> 0:26:49,274
God damn what was he doing?

641
0:26:49,727 --> 0:26:51,376
He swore this

642
0:26:51,376 --> 0:26:53,24
happens too much...

643
0:26:53,478 --> 0:26:56,102
He cleared his throat abruptly and then stood up.

644
0:26:56,555 --> 0:26:59,133
"So, ahem," the girls looked at him.

645
0:26:59,586 --> 0:27:1,862
He opened his words but his throat felt

646
0:27:1,862 --> 0:27:4,137
parched and so, no words came out.

647
0:27:4,591 --> 0:27:7,331
"I'm-I'm gonna go down to get some drink- ye-yeah."

648
0:27:7,784 --> 0:27:9,479
He awkwardly made his way to the door

649
0:27:9,479 --> 0:27:11,174
and left the girls alone.

650
0:27:11,628 --> 0:27:14,113
When they heard Jess go down the stairs, May Belle closed

651
0:27:14,113 --> 0:27:16,597
the door and then turned to Leslie.

652
0:27:17,51 --> 0:27:18,792
"So what was that I saw earlier?"

653
0:27:19,246 --> 0:27:21,126
She smirked, leaning her body on the

654
0:27:21,126 --> 0:27:23,7
door with her arms crossed.

655
0:27:23,461 --> 0:27:26,325
She just heard that Leslie came over and figured that she'd

656
0:27:26,325 --> 0:27:29,188
be in Jess's room, but never did she think that she'd see them

657
0:27:29,188 --> 0:27:32,52
in a position like that.

658
0:27:32,506 --> 0:27:35,431
Leslie let out a sigh and sat on Jess's bed.

659
0:27:35,885 --> 0:27:38,671
She tossed her head back and crossed her arms.

660
0:27:39,125 --> 0:27:41,516
What was she suppose to say, Jess pulled me

661
0:27:41,516 --> 0:27:43,908
over and we almost kissed?

662
0:27:44,362 --> 0:27:45,35
Hell no.

663
0:27:45,488 --> 0:27:46,464
"Pillow fight."

664
0:27:46,917 --> 0:27:47,707
She said.

665
0:27:48,160 --> 0:27:50,993
"Yeah, pillow fight. That's what it was."

666
0:27:51,447 --> 0:27:53,235
Jess shook his head hopelessly.

667
0:27:53,688 --> 0:27:55,627
He pushed his hair back and let his head

668
0:27:55,627 --> 0:27:57,566
thud against the wall.

669
0:27:58,19 --> 0:27:59,761
He closed his eyes and enjoyed the

670
0:27:59,761 --> 0:28:1,502
precious silence he had.

671
0:28:1,956 --> 0:28:4,464
"Get your head straight Jess," he muttered.

672
0:28:4,917 --> 0:28:6,473
"You can't possibly like her."

673
0:28:6,926 --> 0:28:9,279
The only reason why Jess was refusing to accept

674
0:28:9,279 --> 0:28:11,632
the fact that he liked her, was because he knew

675
0:28:11,632 --> 0:28:13,985
that it was impossible.

676
0:28:14,439 --> 0:28:16,227
It was impossible for her to like him and he

677
0:28:16,227 --> 0:28:18,15
was afraid of rejection.

678
0:28:18,468 --> 0:28:20,558
When he presumed that she had 'died' and well

679
0:28:20,558 --> 0:28:22,648
left him, he became different.

680
0:28:23,101 --> 0:28:24,808
He started doing stupid stuff and

681
0:28:24,808 --> 0:28:26,515
dating several girls.

682
0:28:26,968 --> 0:28:29,93
He was afraid that he'd hurt Leslie, the way

683
0:28:29,93 --> 0:28:31,217
he hurt those other girls.

684
0:28:31,671 --> 0:28:32,739
Stupid right?

685
0:28:33,192 --> 0:28:35,781
He let out a soft sigh and opened his brown

686
0:28:35,781 --> 0:28:38,370
eyes, staring at the stairs.

687
0:28:38,824 --> 0:28:40,960
Those falls were happening too much.

688
0:28:41,414 --> 0:28:43,39
He walked to the refrigerator and

689
0:28:43,39 --> 0:28:44,665
got a glass of water.

690
0:28:45,118 --> 0:28:47,742
He slurped them all up and set the glass down.

691
0:28:48,195 --> 0:28:51,144
"What's the matter now," his father's voice said.

692
0:28:51,598 --> 0:28:54,373
He looked at where the voice was coming from and found his father

693
0:28:54,373 --> 0:28:57,147
walking towards him with a strict face.

694
0:28:57,601 --> 0:29:0,271
"You only do that when you're stressed over something."

695
0:29:0,725 --> 0:29:2,652
Jess shook his head to his father.

696
0:29:3,106 --> 0:29:3,872
"It's nothing."

697
0:29:4,325 --> 0:29:5,742
"Doesn't seem like nothing."

698
0:29:6,195 --> 0:29:9,40
His father lowered his voice as he walked past him and got a

699
0:29:9,40 --> 0:29:11,884
glass of juice before sitting down.

700
0:29:12,338 --> 0:29:14,381
"So tell me, what's the problem?"

701
0:29:14,835 --> 0:29:15,670
He stated.

702
0:29:16,124 --> 0:29:18,516
Jess pulled a seat out and then sat on it.

703
0:29:18,969 --> 0:29:20,780
He rested his chin on the palm of his

704
0:29:20,780 --> 0:29:22,591
hand before responding.

705
0:29:23,45 --> 0:29:24,485
"It's Leslie..."

706
0:29:24,938 --> 0:29:26,482
His father seemed to be take a back

707
0:29:26,482 --> 0:29:28,26
from his response.

708
0:29:28,480 --> 0:29:30,221
He raised his eye brow and said, "what

709
0:29:30,221 --> 0:29:31,963
about the Burke girl?"

710
0:29:32,416 --> 0:29:33,183
Burke girl...

711
0:29:33,636 --> 0:29:36,353
Jess managed to let a smirk come to his lips.

712
0:29:36,806 --> 0:29:38,374
"I

713
0:29:38,374 --> 0:29:39,941
think..."

714
0:29:40,395 --> 0:29:41,184
He trailed.

715
0:29:41,638 --> 0:29:42,752
"I think that I..."

716
0:29:43,206 --> 0:29:45,609
He drifted his words and looked at his father who

717
0:29:45,609 --> 0:29:48,12
looked as if he was getting impatient.

718
0:29:48,466 --> 0:29:49,696
"I think I like her."

719
0:29:50,150 --> 0:29:51,381
He finally said.

720
0:29:51,834 --> 0:29:53,610
His father leaned back on the chair

721
0:29:53,610 --> 0:29:55,387
and crossed his arms.

722
0:29:55,840 --> 0:29:57,744
His son likes his best friend.

723
0:29:58,198 --> 0:30:0,9
What a complicated situation.

724
0:30:0,462 --> 0:30:2,88
Especially with his kind.

725
0:30:2,541 --> 0:30:4,469
He looked at his son who looked confused over

726
0:30:4,469 --> 0:30:6,396
his feelings towards Leslie.

727
0:30:6,849 --> 0:30:8,672
He cleared his throat, "so what's the

728
0:30:8,672 --> 0:30:10,495
problem with liking her?"

729
0:30:10,948 --> 0:30:12,632
His tone sounded more like a demand

730
0:30:12,632 --> 0:30:14,315
rather than a question.

731
0:30:14,769 --> 0:30:16,766
"The problem is that I can't like her."

732
0:30:17,219 --> 0:30:18,520
Jess almost yelled.

733
0:30:18,973 --> 0:30:20,633
He didn't understand it himself, but

734
0:30:20,633 --> 0:30:22,294
he just couldn't like her.

735
0:30:22,747 --> 0:30:25,510
Maybe the thing with Leslie was just puppy love like the

736
0:30:25,510 --> 0:30:28,273
same with Miss Edmunds, nothing more.

737
0:30:28,727 --> 0:30:30,585
Maybe it'd pass over time.

738
0:30:31,38 --> 0:30:33,755
With that being said, Jess shook his head.

739
0:30:34,208 --> 0:30:36,228
"I didn't mean it that way," he sighed.

740
0:30:36,682 --> 0:30:38,923
"Leslie's my friend. My best

741
0:30:38,923 --> 0:30:41,163
friend. That's all she is."

742
0:30:41,617 --> 0:30:43,207
His father looked at him for a minute

743
0:30:43,207 --> 0:30:44,798
before letting out a sigh.

744
0:30:45,252 --> 0:30:47,719
"You really won't know if you like a girl. You might

745
0:30:47,719 --> 0:30:50,186
like her as a friend, or your best friend, or even as

746
0:30:50,186 --> 0:30:52,653
a girl. You won't really know until the right time

747
0:30:52,653 --> 0:30:55,120
comes."

748
0:30:55,574 --> 0:30:57,292
Jess raised his head up and looked

749
0:30:57,292 --> 0:30:59,10
at his father's face.

750
0:30:59,464 --> 0:31:0,834
His father had a point.

751
0:31:1,287 --> 0:31:3,656
Maybe what he was feeling is just normal.

752
0:31:4,109 --> 0:31:5,723
Normal for a guy his age to care

753
0:31:5,723 --> 0:31:7,337
about his best friend.

754
0:31:7,790 --> 0:31:10,704
And obviously a teenaged guy like him will blush at situations

755
0:31:10,704 --> 0:31:13,618
where their faces are very close to each other.

756
0:31:14,72 --> 0:31:15,906
"Thanks dad," he said, letting a

757
0:31:15,906 --> 0:31:17,741
smirk grow on his lips.

758
0:31:18,194 --> 0:31:20,307
"Didn't know that you could give advice like this

759
0:31:20,307 --> 0:31:22,420
since you've always been that sorta-"

760
0:31:22,874 --> 0:31:25,227
"Well you're old man's gotten lot of

761
0:31:25,227 --> 0:31:27,580
experience," his father abruptly stood up and

762
0:31:27,580 --> 0:31:29,933
drank all the juice in his glass.

763
0:31:30,386 --> 0:31:32,406
"I need to go for another shift now."

764
0:31:32,860 --> 0:31:35,635
He ruffled his son's hair and retreated back to the living room to

765
0:31:35,635 --> 0:31:38,409
kiss his wife before leaving the house.

766
0:31:38,863 --> 0:31:40,929
As he watched his father's truck drive

767
0:31:40,929 --> 0:31:42,996
away from the land and onto the road, a

768
0:31:42,996 --> 0:31:45,63
realization struck him.

769
0:31:45,516 --> 0:31:48,179
He knew that Leslie liked to poke into his things when they

770
0:31:48,179 --> 0:31:50,841
were younger so it's likely that she'll still do the same

771
0:31:50,841 --> 0:31:53,504
thing, maybe even worser.

772
0:31:53,957 --> 0:31:56,24
His eyes darted to the stairs.

773
0:31:56,477 --> 0:31:58,497
He had to hide it before Leslie or even

774
0:31:58,497 --> 0:32:0,518
May Belle could find it.

775
0:32:0,971 --> 0:32:2,999
Beneath his bed,

776
0:32:2,999 --> 0:32:5,27
was his dirty

777
0:32:5,27 --> 0:32:7,55
little stash...

778
0:32:7,508 --> 0:32:9,691
He's a boy, what would you expect.

779
0:32:10,144 --> 0:32:12,443
He quickly rushed up to the stairs, not too

780
0:32:12,443 --> 0:32:14,742
quickly as the girls might hear him but still

781
0:32:14,742 --> 0:32:17,41
quick enough for he was anxious that they'd find

782
0:32:17,41 --> 0:32:19,340
it any minute now.

783
0:32:19,793 --> 0:32:22,649
Leslie did like to poke around people's things.

784
0:32:23,103 --> 0:32:25,564
Well, just the people she's close to.

785
0:32:26,17 --> 0:32:28,935
Knowing that Jess was still downstairs and won't be coming

786
0:32:28,935 --> 0:32:31,853
up anytime soon, the 2 girls went around his room, trying to

787
0:32:31,853 --> 0:32:34,771
find for anything dirty.

788
0:32:35,225 --> 0:32:36,966
"How old are you again May Belle?"

789
0:32:37,420 --> 0:32:39,80
Leslie asked as she opened a book

790
0:32:39,80 --> 0:32:40,740
from Jess's shelf.

791
0:32:41,194 --> 0:32:43,226
"12," May Belle responded

792
0:32:43,226 --> 0:32:45,257
cheekily, opening drawers.

793
0:32:45,711 --> 0:32:46,361
"Why?"

794
0:32:46,815 --> 0:32:48,382
Leslie shrugged her shoulders

795
0:32:48,382 --> 0:32:49,949
and then closed the book.

796
0:32:50,403 --> 0:32:53,317
"I just didn't

797
0:32:53,317 --> 0:32:56,231
know that 6th

798
0:32:56,231 --> 0:32:59,145
graders were

799
0:32:59,145 --> 0:33:2,59
this..."

800
0:33:2,513 --> 0:33:3,70
"Dirty?"

801
0:33:3,523 --> 0:33:5,637
May Belle cut her off with a smirk.

802
0:33:6,90 --> 0:33:7,878
"Well I was gonna say mature."

803
0:33:8,331 --> 0:33:10,624
Earlier before they started snooping around, they

804
0:33:10,624 --> 0:33:12,917
were just having that friendly girl talk with Leslie

805
0:33:12,917 --> 0:33:15,210
giving girl advice to May Belle about a certain crush

806
0:33:15,210 --> 0:33:17,503
of hers in school.

807
0:33:17,957 --> 0:33:20,310
Strangely, the topic suddenly turned to Jess

808
0:33:20,310 --> 0:33:22,663
and then stranger things, until May Belle

809
0:33:22,663 --> 0:33:25,16
suggested doing something.

810
0:33:25,469 --> 0:33:27,48
"Jess's 17, he's gotta have

811
0:33:27,48 --> 0:33:28,627
something here!"

812
0:33:29,81 --> 0:33:30,358
She bit her lower lip.

813
0:33:30,811 --> 0:33:33,191
She tried looking at his drawers, in his

814
0:33:33,191 --> 0:33:35,571
books, in his closets, everywhere!

815
0:33:36,25 --> 0:33:37,975
But they couldn't find a single thing.

816
0:33:38,429 --> 0:33:40,809
On the other hand, Leslie was feeling pretty stupid

817
0:33:40,809 --> 0:33:43,189
about doing this to Jess's room.

818
0:33:43,642 --> 0:33:46,371
She looked at the closet where Jess's clothes were scattered all

819
0:33:46,371 --> 0:33:49,99
over the place from May Belle's rummaging.

820
0:33:49,553 --> 0:33:51,751
She felt pretty bad about messing up his

821
0:33:51,751 --> 0:33:53,949
room, even though she wasn't the one who

822
0:33:53,949 --> 0:33:56,147
completely messed it all up.

823
0:33:56,601 --> 0:33:58,737
Leslie threw a glance over to Jess's

824
0:33:58,737 --> 0:34:0,873
bed, and then below it.

825
0:34:1,327 --> 0:34:3,989
She might've been away from the outside world for

826
0:34:3,989 --> 0:34:6,652
5 years, but she pretty much had a very open mind

827
0:34:6,652 --> 0:34:9,314
when she was just 12.

828
0:34:9,768 --> 0:34:11,765
"Did you try looking under his bed?"

829
0:34:12,218 --> 0:34:14,784
May Belle's head perked up and instantly crawled to his

830
0:34:14,784 --> 0:34:17,350
bed before literally going under it.

831
0:34:17,803 --> 0:34:20,752
A few seconds later, she returned with a magazine.

832
0:34:21,206 --> 0:34:23,795
A mischievous smile crept up to her lips as she raised the

833
0:34:23,795 --> 0:34:26,384
magazine in her hand and showed it to her.

834
0:34:26,837 --> 0:34:29,368
"Look what I

835
0:34:29,368 --> 0:34:31,899
found..."

836
0:34:32,353 --> 0:34:33,282
She snickered.

837
0:34:33,735 --> 0:34:36,138
Jess was going to open the door to his room until he

838
0:34:36,138 --> 0:34:38,542
heard giggles coming from inside.

839
0:34:38,995 --> 0:34:40,864
He stopped in his tracks and decided to

840
0:34:40,864 --> 0:34:42,734
stay outside for a bit.

841
0:34:43,187 --> 0:34:45,22
"Oh my god, look at this!"

842
0:34:45,475 --> 0:34:48,470
He heard Leslie's voice, a laugh following later.

843
0:34:48,924 --> 0:34:51,25
He raised his eye brow in question as he

844
0:34:51,25 --> 0:34:53,127
pressed his ear to the door.

845
0:34:53,580 --> 0:34:55,90
They couldn't have, could they?

846
0:34:55,543 --> 0:34:58,213
As he continued listening to that confusing things

847
0:34:58,213 --> 0:35:0,884
he could hear, a voice startled him.

848
0:35:1,337 --> 0:35:2,266
"What are you doing?"

849
0:35:2,719 --> 0:35:5,227
Jess literally jumped up from the sound, making his

850
0:35:5,227 --> 0:35:7,735
head thud against the wooden door.

851
0:35:8,189 --> 0:35:8,490
"Mmm!"

852
0:35:8,944 --> 0:35:10,836
He groaned in pain, not letting the

853
0:35:10,836 --> 0:35:12,729
yelp escape from his mouth.

854
0:35:13,182 --> 0:35:14,761
He winced as he raised his head up

855
0:35:14,761 --> 0:35:16,340
to see who it was.

856
0:35:16,794 --> 0:35:19,952


857
0:35:19,952 --> 0:35:23,110
"Shhh!"

858
0:35:23,563 --> 0:35:25,990
He held his finger to his lips, shushing his

859
0:35:25,990 --> 0:35:28,416
little sister, Joyce Ann.

860
0:35:28,870 --> 0:35:30,483
He kneeled down to her height and

861
0:35:30,483 --> 0:35:32,97
looked straight at her.

862
0:35:32,551 --> 0:35:34,60
"Don't make any sound."

863
0:35:34,513 --> 0:35:36,139
He sharply whispered to her.

864
0:35:36,592 --> 0:35:39,7
Joyce Ann looked at him with a puzzled expression.

865
0:35:39,461 --> 0:35:41,643
Instead of nodding to his words, he walked past

866
0:35:41,643 --> 0:35:43,826
him and knocked on the door.

867
0:35:44,280 --> 0:35:44,907
"Hello?"

868
0:35:45,360 --> 0:35:46,985
Jess immediately grabbed her by the

869
0:35:46,985 --> 0:35:48,611
waist and pulled her to him.

870
0:35:49,64 --> 0:35:51,386
"Didn't I say to not make a sound?"

871
0:35:51,840 --> 0:35:52,699
He cried.

872
0:35:53,153 --> 0:35:55,33
Footsteps came along before the door

873
0:35:55,33 --> 0:35:56,914
opened, revealing Leslie.

874
0:35:57,368 --> 0:35:58,807
"Oh Jess," she chirped.

875
0:35:59,261 --> 0:36:1,385
Her eyes looked down at him before noticing that

876
0:36:1,385 --> 0:36:3,510
he was carrying a small child.

877
0:36:3,964 --> 0:36:6,564
Her eyes brightened at the sight of Joyce Ann.

878
0:36:7,18 --> 0:36:9,166
May Belle could be seen in the room with her head poked

879
0:36:9,166 --> 0:36:11,313
out to see what was happening.

880
0:36:11,767 --> 0:36:13,450
As soon as she saw Joyce Ann, her face

881
0:36:13,450 --> 0:36:15,134
turned into a frown.

882
0:36:15,587 --> 0:36:17,747
He stood up from his position and went

883
0:36:17,747 --> 0:36:19,906
inside with Joyce tagging along.

884
0:36:20,360 --> 0:36:23,123
His eyes looked at the floor, noticing the pile of

885
0:36:23,123 --> 0:36:25,886
clothes on the ground, and his books on the shelf that

886
0:36:25,886 --> 0:36:28,649
was supposedly to be in order.

887
0:36:29,103 --> 0:36:30,937
"What did you guys do to my room?"

888
0:36:31,391 --> 0:36:33,179
May Belle rolled her eyes at him.

889
0:36:33,632 --> 0:36:36,442
"Just a bit reorganizing, oh and this."

890
0:36:36,895 --> 0:36:39,682
She raised the magazine up to his face and smirked.

891
0:36:40,135 --> 0:36:41,853
The contents of the magazine that she and

892
0:36:41,853 --> 0:36:43,572
Leslie peeked in were ...

893
0:36:44,25 --> 0:36:45,999
Well, disappointing for her since she

894
0:36:45,999 --> 0:36:47,973
thought that there'd be more.

895
0:36:48,426 --> 0:36:50,667
Leslie laughed at the sight of Jess's face as he

896
0:36:50,667 --> 0:36:52,908
grabbed the magazine in horror.

897
0:36:53,361 --> 0:36:56,345
"What are you

898
0:36:56,345 --> 0:36:59,329
doing with-"

899
0:36:59,782 --> 0:37:1,942
She cut him off with a cheeky smile.

900
0:37:2,395 --> 0:37:4,148
"You're magazine? Yeah we decided to

901
0:37:4,148 --> 0:37:5,901
snoop around a little."

902
0:37:6,355 --> 0:37:8,956
She looked over to Joyce Ann who had that innocent little

903
0:37:8,956 --> 0:37:11,556
face ever since she got into the room.

904
0:37:12,10 --> 0:37:13,705
"What's that magazine about?"

905
0:37:14,158 --> 0:37:15,749
She innocently asked as she

906
0:37:15,749 --> 0:37:17,339
pointed to the magazine.

907
0:37:17,793 --> 0:37:20,115
She went over to Jess's bed where the rest of the girls

908
0:37:20,115 --> 0:37:22,437
were at and sat next to Leslie.

909
0:37:22,890 --> 0:37:25,3
May Belle looked at Joyce Ann in disgust for

910
0:37:25,3 --> 0:37:27,116
some reason and rolled her eyes.

911
0:37:27,570 --> 0:37:30,124
Noticing May Belle's behavior to Joyce, Leslie looked

912
0:37:30,124 --> 0:37:32,678
at Jess and gave him a look before returning her

913
0:37:32,678 --> 0:37:35,233
attention back to the little one.

914
0:37:35,686 --> 0:37:36,452
"It's nothing."

915
0:37:36,906 --> 0:37:38,113
Jess simply said.

916
0:37:38,567 --> 0:37:40,765
He walked to his study table and opened one of

917
0:37:40,765 --> 0:37:42,963
the drawers, shoving the magazine in it before

918
0:37:42,963 --> 0:37:45,161
locking it with a key.

919
0:37:45,615 --> 0:37:48,184
There

920
0:37:48,184 --> 0:37:50,754
we

921
0:37:50,754 --> 0:37:53,324
go...

922
0:37:53,777 --> 0:37:55,600
After making sure that there weren't anymore dirty stuff of his

923
0:37:55,600 --> 0:37:57,423
in the room, he let out a sigh in relief.

924
0:37:57,876 --> 0:38:0,779
Leslie smiled as she leaned on the wall near the bed.

925
0:38:1,232 --> 0:38:2,370
"You're so big now!"

926
0:38:2,824 --> 0:38:5,215
Joyce looked at her with an innocent face.

927
0:38:5,669 --> 0:38:7,39
"Have I met you before?"

928
0:38:7,492 --> 0:38:8,584
She asked.

929
0:38:9,37 --> 0:38:11,986
Of course she wouldn't remember, she was still a baby.

930
0:38:12,440 --> 0:38:15,110
Hearing Joyce Ann's words, May Belle crossed her arms and

931
0:38:15,110 --> 0:38:17,780
rolled her eyes away before letting out a sigh.

932
0:38:18,234 --> 0:38:21,206
"No, of course not," she sarcastically said.

933
0:38:21,659 --> 0:38:24,28
"She knows you so of course you don't know her."

934
0:38:24,481 --> 0:38:26,478
"Okay May Belle, that's enough."

935
0:38:26,932 --> 0:38:28,511
Jess approached them to bed and

936
0:38:28,511 --> 0:38:30,90
ticked her on the forehead.

937
0:38:30,543 --> 0:38:33,213
Sometimes May Belle could be harsh to Joyce, which most

938
0:38:33,213 --> 0:38:35,884
of the time the older siblings would need to intervene

939
0:38:35,884 --> 0:38:38,554
or else Joyce would cry.

940
0:38:39,8 --> 0:38:41,399
Leslie looked back at Joyce and noticed that

941
0:38:41,399 --> 0:38:43,791
she was glaring at May Belle, but also almost

942
0:38:43,791 --> 0:38:46,183
at the verge of tears.

943
0:38:46,636 --> 0:38:47,635
"Really May Belle?"

944
0:38:48,88 --> 0:38:48,878
She said.

945
0:38:49,331 --> 0:38:49,842
"What?"

946
0:38:50,295 --> 0:38:53,151
May Belle asked, flabbergasted as if she was some

947
0:38:53,151 --> 0:38:56,7
innocent little girl who didn't do anything.

948
0:38:56,461 --> 0:38:58,319
May Belle tossed her head back and

949
0:38:58,319 --> 0:39:0,176
then rolled her eyes away.

950
0:39:0,630 --> 0:39:2,23
"Fine," she grunted.

951
0:39:2,476 --> 0:39:3,637
"Sorry Joyce."

952
0:39:4,91 --> 0:39:5,670
She reluctantly apologized

953
0:39:5,670 --> 0:39:7,249
half-heartedly to Joyce.

954
0:39:7,702 --> 0:39:10,40
After doing so, Joyce Ann smiled and got off

955
0:39:10,40 --> 0:39:12,377
the bed, taking May Belle's hand and dragging

956
0:39:12,377 --> 0:39:14,715
her out of the room.

957
0:39:15,168 --> 0:39:17,525
As they watched Joyce Ann drag May Belle out the

958
0:39:17,525 --> 0:39:19,882
room and into the hallway, they heard May Belle's

959
0:39:19,882 --> 0:39:22,239
words of trying to stop Joyce Ann until they heard

960
0:39:22,239 --> 0:39:24,596
the door shut.

961
0:39:25,49 --> 0:39:26,930
"What's with all that yammering about?"

962
0:39:27,383 --> 0:39:29,880
An annoyed Brenda yelled from her room, causing

963
0:39:29,880 --> 0:39:32,376
both Jess and Leslie to laugh.

964
0:39:32,829 --> 0:39:34,965
With May Belle and Joyce Ann now out of the

965
0:39:34,965 --> 0:39:37,102
room, they were finally alone.

966
0:39:37,555 --> 0:39:39,494
Jess walked to the door and closed it before

967
0:39:39,494 --> 0:39:41,433
sitting on his arm chair.

968
0:39:41,886 --> 0:39:43,767
"Joyce grew up fast huh?"

969
0:39:44,221 --> 0:39:45,335
Leslie grinned.

970
0:39:45,789 --> 0:39:48,273
She blew the strands of hair that was covering her face

971
0:39:48,273 --> 0:39:50,758
and then pushed it behind her ear.

972
0:39:51,211 --> 0:39:52,814
"Yeah," he replied.

973
0:39:53,267 --> 0:39:54,776
"Almost too fast."

974
0:39:55,230 --> 0:39:57,122
Jess raised his eye brow, "how'd you

975
0:39:57,122 --> 0:39:59,15
even know that it was her?"

976
0:39:59,468 --> 0:40:1,233
Leslie shifted her position

977
0:40:1,233 --> 0:40:2,998
and sat crossed legged.

978
0:40:3,451 --> 0:40:5,460
"Well it kinda made sense. The baby back

979
0:40:5,460 --> 0:40:7,468
then and her and all..."

980
0:40:7,922 --> 0:40:10,81
Jess shrugged his shoulders at her answer.

981
0:40:10,535 --> 0:40:11,510
Made sense.

982
0:40:11,964 --> 0:40:14,185
She met Joyce back when she was still a baby when she

983
0:40:14,185 --> 0:40:16,406
came to the house to wash up after Janice squirted

984
0:40:16,406 --> 0:40:18,628
ketchup all over her.

985
0:40:19,81 --> 0:40:21,775
Though it's weird how she could recognize Joyce.

986
0:40:22,228 --> 0:40:24,469
She looked outside his window and noticed that

987
0:40:24,469 --> 0:40:26,710
the rain was now just drizzling.

988
0:40:27,163 --> 0:40:28,464
"The rain has stopped."

989
0:40:28,917 --> 0:40:29,707
She said.

990
0:40:30,160 --> 0:40:31,832
Jess looked over to the window and

991
0:40:31,832 --> 0:40:33,504
noticed it as well.

992
0:40:33,957 --> 0:40:35,815
"Yeah," he quietly said.

993
0:40:36,268 --> 0:40:37,476
"You wanna go home?"

994
0:40:37,929 --> 0:40:39,903
"Well I'm sure that I have a lot of things to do

995
0:40:39,903 --> 0:40:41,877
later for school tomorrow."

996
0:40:42,330 --> 0:40:43,932
She snickered as she got up and

997
0:40:43,932 --> 0:40:45,535
tidied her shirt.

998
0:40:45,988 --> 0:40:48,751
She walked out of his room and down the stairs.

999
0:40:49,205 --> 0:40:50,911
Jess later took another wind breaker of

1000
0:40:50,911 --> 0:40:52,618
his and followed her down.

1001
0:40:53,72 --> 0:40:55,289
When he got down, wearing his jacket, he saw

1002
0:40:55,289 --> 0:40:57,507
Leslie talking with his mother.

1003
0:40:57,960 --> 0:41:0,874
"Thanks for letting me stay here Mrs Aarons," Leslie

1004
0:41:0,874 --> 0:41:3,788
smiled and put her hands behind her back.

1005
0:41:4,242 --> 0:41:5,821
"I really appreciate it."

1006
0:41:6,274 --> 0:41:8,875
Mrs Aarons returned a small smile to her.

1007
0:41:9,328 --> 0:41:11,233
She brought her hands to Leslie's

1008
0:41:11,233 --> 0:41:13,137
shoulder and shook it gently.

1009
0:41:13,590 --> 0:41:14,914
"I'm glad you're here."

1010
0:41:15,367 --> 0:41:17,910
Jess quietly crept down the stairs and wore his

1011
0:41:17,910 --> 0:41:20,452
jacket over before getting an umbrella.

1012
0:41:20,906 --> 0:41:22,705
He went to the door and opened it,

1013
0:41:22,705 --> 0:41:24,505
looking over to Leslie.

1014
0:41:24,958 --> 0:41:25,585
"You ready?"

1015
0:41:26,39 --> 0:41:27,14
He asked.

1016
0:41:27,468 --> 0:41:29,650
"You don't have to walk me back ya know."

1017
0:41:30,104 --> 0:41:32,635
Leslie walked over to him and wore a grin.

1018
0:41:33,88 --> 0:41:35,74
They both walked out of the house and looked at

1019
0:41:35,74 --> 0:41:37,59
the muddy pools of puddles.

1020
0:41:37,512 --> 0:41:40,392
Jess shook his head with a chuckle as he opened the

1021
0:41:40,392 --> 0:41:43,271
umbrella and raised it above their heads.

1022
0:41:43,724 --> 0:41:45,582
He closed the door behind him.

1023
0:41:46,36 --> 0:41:47,127
"I insist."

1024
0:41:47,580 --> 0:41:49,20
"So are you actually ready?"

1025
0:41:49,474 --> 0:41:50,983
Jess finally asked.

1026
0:41:51,436 --> 0:41:53,515
They walked up to the stairs of the front porch where

1027
0:41:53,515 --> 0:41:55,593
there was a roof over their heads.

1028
0:41:56,46 --> 0:41:58,310
Leslie raised her eye brow in question as she

1029
0:41:58,310 --> 0:42:0,574
watched him close the umbrella.

1030
0:42:1,28 --> 0:42:2,26
"Ready for what?"

1031
0:42:2,480 --> 0:42:4,477
"Tomorrow, school of course."

1032
0:42:4,930 --> 0:42:5,696
He grinned.

1033
0:42:6,150 --> 0:42:7,984
He knocked at the front door, waiting for

1034
0:42:7,984 --> 0:42:9,819
one of the Burke's to answer.

1035
0:42:10,272 --> 0:42:12,908
Leslie folded her arms to her chest and closed her

1036
0:42:12,908 --> 0:42:15,543
eyes, thinking about his question.

1037
0:42:15,997 --> 0:42:17,436
"Yeah, I guess I am."

1038
0:42:17,890 --> 0:42:18,679
She nodded.

1039
0:42:19,133 --> 0:42:20,805
The door then opened, revealing

1040
0:42:20,805 --> 0:42:22,476
Judy wearing her glasses.

1041
0:42:22,930 --> 0:42:25,159
"Oh you're back," she looked at Leslie and noticed the

1042
0:42:25,159 --> 0:42:27,388
different clothes she was wearing.

1043
0:42:27,842 --> 0:42:28,701
"What happened?"

1044
0:42:29,154 --> 0:42:30,849
A laugh came out from Leslie's lips

1045
0:42:30,849 --> 0:42:32,544
as she looked at Jess.

1046
0:42:32,998 --> 0:42:34,205
"Long story mom."

1047
0:42:34,659 --> 0:42:35,495
She smirked.

1048
0:42:35,948 --> 0:42:38,433
Just remembering that her clothes was still

1049
0:42:38,433 --> 0:42:40,917
back at Jess's place, she blushed.

1050
0:42:41,371 --> 0:42:42,602
"Oh my clothes!"

1051
0:42:43,55 --> 0:42:45,586
Jess looked behind him and to his house.

1052
0:42:46,40 --> 0:42:47,978
They forgot to take Leslie's clothes

1053
0:42:47,978 --> 0:42:49,917
along with them when they left.

1054
0:42:50,371 --> 0:42:51,996
He then told her that he'd give it to her

1055
0:42:51,996 --> 0:42:53,622
tomorrow morning when they meet.

1056
0:42:54,75 --> 0:42:56,188
After exchanging words with one another,

1057
0:42:56,188 --> 0:42:58,301
it was time for him to leave.

1058
0:42:58,755 --> 0:43:0,976
He grabbed his umbrella and put it over his head

1059
0:43:0,976 --> 0:43:3,197
before walking out of the Burke's property and

1060
0:43:3,197 --> 0:43:5,419
heading out to his house.

1061
0:43:5,872 --> 0:43:7,649
Leslie and Judy watched him walk away as

1062
0:43:7,649 --> 0:43:9,425
the rain poured harder.

1063
0:43:9,879 --> 0:43:12,827
"Come on," Judy walked back inside the living room.

1064
0:43:13,281 --> 0:43:15,727
Leslie stayed behind for a few more minutes as she

1065
0:43:15,727 --> 0:43:18,173
stared at Jess before he changed direction and

1066
0:43:18,173 --> 0:43:20,618
walked back to his house.
